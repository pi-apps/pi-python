# Pi Network - Python server-side package

This is a user generated Python-based solution for Pi Network you can use to integrate the Pi Network apps platform with a Python backend application.

pi_python.py is the Library and pi_python_test.py is to test the Library.


## Example

1. Initialize the SDK and enter your secret data
```python
""" Secret Data """
api_key = "Enter Here Your API Key" 
wallet_private_seed = "SecretWalletSeed" 

""" Initialization """
pi = PiNetwork()
pi.initialize(api_key, wallet_private_seed, "Pi Testnet")
```

2. Create an A2U payment

Make sure to store your payment data in your database. Here's an example of how you could keep track of the data.
Consider this a database table example.

| uid | product_id | amount | memo | payment_id | txid |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `user_uid` | apple-pie-1 | 3.14 | Refund for apple pie | NULL | NULL |

```python
user_uid = "GET-THIS-SECRET-DATA-FROMFRONTEND" #unique for every user


""" Build your payment """
payment_data = {
  "amount": 3.14,
  "memo": "Test - Greetings from MyApp",
  "metadata": {"product_id": "apple-pie-1"},
  "uid": user_uid
}

""" 
    Create an payment 
    It is critical that you store paymentId in your database
    so that you don't double-pay the same user, by keeping track of the payment.

"""
payment_id = pi.create_payment(payment_data)
```

3. Store the `paymentId` in your database

After creating the payment, you'll get `paymentId`, which you should be storing in your database.

| uid | product_id | amount | memo | payment_id | txid |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `user_uid` | apple-pie-1 | 3.14 | Refund for apple pie | `paymentId` | NULL |

4. Submit the payment to the Pi Blockchain
```python
"""It is strongly recommended that you store the txid along with the paymentId you stored earlier for your reference."""
txid = pi.submit_payment(payment_id, False)
```

5. Store the txid in your database

Similarly as you did in step 3, keep the txid along with other data.

| uid | product_id | amount | memo | payment_id | txid |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `user_uid` | apple-pie-1 | 3.14 | Refund for apple pie | `paymentId` | `txid` |

6. Complete the payment
```python
payment = pi.complete_payment(payment_id, txid)
```

## Overall flow for A2U (App-to-User) payment

To create an A2U payment using the Pi Python SDK, here's an overall flow you need to follow:

1. Initialize the SDK
> You'll be initializing the SDK with the Pi API Key of your app and the Private Seed of your app wallet.

2. Create an A2U payment
> You can create an A2U payment using `createPayment` method. This method returns a payment identifier (payment id).

3. Store the payment id in your database
> It is critical that you store the payment id, returned by `createPayment` method, in your database so that you don't double-pay the same user, by keeping track of the payment.

4. Submit the payment to the Pi Blockchain
> You can submit the payment to the Pi Blockchain using `submitPayment` method. This method builds a payment transaction and submits it to the Pi Blockchain for you. Once submitted, the method returns a transaction identifier (txid).

5. Store the txid in your database
> It is strongly recommended that you store the txid along with the payment id you stored earlier for your reference.

6. Complete the payment
> After checking the transaction with the txid you obtained, you must complete the payment, which you can do with `completePayment` method. Upon completing, the method returns the payment object. Check the `status` field to make sure everything looks correct.

## SDK Reference

This section shows you a list of available methods.
### `createPayment`

This method creates an A2U payment.

- Required parameter: `PaymentArgs`

You need to provide 4 different data and pass them as a single object to this method.
```typescript
type PaymentArgs = {
  amount: number // the amount of Pi you're paying to your user
  memo: string // a short memo that describes what the payment is about
  metadata: object // an arbitrary object that you can attach to this payment. This is for your own use. You should use this object as a way to link this payment with your internal business logic.
  uid: string // a user uid of your app. You should have access to this value if a user has authenticated on your app.
}
```

- Return value: `a payment identifier (paymentId: string)`

### `submitPayment`

This method creates a payment transaction and submits it to the Pi Blockchain.

- Required parameter: `paymentId, pending_payments`
- Return value: `a transaction identifier (txid: string)`

### `completePayment`

This method completes the payment in the Pi server.

- Required parameter: `paymentId, txid`
- Return value: `a payment object (payment: PaymentDTO)`

The method return a payment object with the following fields:

```typescript
payment: PaymentDTO = {
  // Payment data:
  identifier: string, // payment identifier
  user_uid: string, // user's app-specific ID
  amount: number, // payment amount
  memo: string, // a string provided by the developer, shown to the user
  metadata: object, // an object provided by the developer for their own usage
  from_address: string, // sender address of the blockchain transaction
  to_address: string, // recipient address of the blockchain transaction
  direction: Direction, // direction of the payment ("user_to_app" | "app_to_user")
  created_at: string, // payment's creation timestamp
  network: string, // a network of the payment ("Pi Network" | "Pi Testnet")
  // Status flags representing the current state of this payment
  status: {
    developer_approved: boolean, // Server-Side Approval (automatically approved for A2U payment)
    transaction_verified: boolean, // blockchain transaction verified
    developer_completed: boolean, // Server-Side Completion (handled by the create_payment! method)
    cancelled: boolean, // cancelled by the developer or by Pi Network
    user_cancelled: boolean, // cancelled by the user
  },
  // Blockchain transaction data:
  transaction: null | { // This is null if no transaction has been made yet
    txid: string, // id of the blockchain transaction
    verified: boolean, // true if the transaction matches the payment, false otherwise
    _link: string, // a link to the operation on the Pi Blockchain API
  }
}
```

### `getPayment`

This method returns a payment object if it exists.

- Required parameter: `paymentId`
- Return value: `a payment object (payment: PaymentDTO)`

### `cancelPayment`

This method cancels the payment in the Pi server.

- Required parameter: `paymentId`
- Return value: `a payment object (payment: PaymentDTO)`

### `getIncompleteServerPayments`

This method returns the latest incomplete payment which your app has created, if present. Use this method to troubleshoot the following error: "You need to complete the ongoing payment first to create a new one."

- Required parameter: `none`
- Return value: `an array which contains 0 or 1 payment object (payments: Array<PaymentDTO>)`

If a payment is returned by this method, you must follow one of the following 3 options:

1. cancel the payment, if it is not linked with a blockchain transaction and you don't want to submit the transaction anymore

2. submit the transaction and complete the payment

3. if a blockchain transaction has been made, complete the payment

If you do not know what this payment maps to in your business logic, you may use its `metadata` property to retrieve which business logic item it relates to. Remember that `metadata` is a required argument when creating a payment, and should be used as a way to link this payment to an item of your business logic.

## Troubleshooting

### Error when creating a payment: "You need to complete the ongoing payment first to create a new one."

See documentation for the `getIncompleteServerPayments` above.
